# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project 

In this project I conduct an investment analysis on the historical data of 12 green stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. I use the built-in developer program in Excel called Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to conduct this analysis. The code I run is a refactored code that when compared to the original script gives me a faster result. I provide insights by comparing my stocks performance in 2017 and 2018, I underscore the pros and cons of refactoring, and lastly I clarify how the pros and cons apply to refactoring this code. 

## Purpose 

The purpose of this study is to help Steve help his parents formulate a well devised investment plan by considering the data of 12 green stocks across two consecutive years: 2017 and 2018. Since financial markets are considered 'random walks', it is very unlikely to predict future market fluctuations in light of past data. That is why the conclusion I provide only gives an idea of how the stocks did in the past.    

# Results 

## Comparative Stock Performance Result 

Overall, we can say that the stock market performed much better in 2017 compared to 2018. The top performing stock was DQ with a high return rate of about 200%. This may be one of the main reasons Steve's parents wanted to invest in the stock DQ. However, when the stock market did very bad in 2018, the worst performing stock was DQ. I can simply conclude that the stock DQ has a high beta ratio. This means that when the stock market is doing good, DQ is performing much better than the market and in contrast when the marekt is doing bad, DQ is performing worse than the market. Below I provide the results of 12 of the stocks according to their total daily volume and there return for 2017 and 2018, respectively.

## Refactoring the Code 

It takes the original VBA script 0.61 seconds to run the data in 2017, while it takes only 0.08 seconds to run the refactored code as can be seen in image 1 and image 2.

On the other had, it takes the original VBA script 0.60 seconds to run the data in 2018, while it takes only 0.86 to run the refactored code, as can be seen in image 3 and image 4.

# Summary 

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring. 

Refactoring is the process of changing the codes internal structure without altering its external behavior. According to Mr Martin Fowler there are four reasons to refactor: to improve design, make uderstanding the software easier, and help us debug and run the code faster. In essence it is a process of optimizing the way the code runs. The downside of refactoring is that it consumes a lot of time and it may be harder for the person who did not write the original code to refactor the code.
